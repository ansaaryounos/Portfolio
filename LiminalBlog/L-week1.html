      <p>This week marked the beginning of my internship at Liminal VR, a Melbourne-based studio. The company focuses on creating immersive experiences that elicit specific emotions through a deep understanding and thorough research of human psychology. Since COVID-19, the company has shifted to remote work, meaning that my first interaction was through a Zoom meeting. I became acquainted with my fellow Interns, who are also students at RMIT; David, Lisa & Hari. In an effort to get to know one another, we shared our previous digital media works, which gave us an understanding of each other’s backgrounds and skills. </p>

      <br>
      <p>Before beginning any design work, I was advised to read through the company’s psych documentation, which demonstrates the psychological principles underpinning the implementation of their virtual reality experiences. It touched on different emotions, such as calmness & awe, while offering guidelines on how to induce particular emotional and cognitive states while maintaining the cognitive load. This was important as it allowed me to now make informed design decisions aligned with Liminal’s purpose.</p>

      <br>
      <p>During my internship at Liminal, the objective of myself and the other interns is to create a highly-refined virtual reality experience that induced a sense of calmness, to be published onto their platform. As I was a later addition to the team, there was already a concept for an experience drafted up. I read through the design doc to familiarise myself and catch up to speed with the rest of the team, also offering personal opinions and ideas. In essence, the settled idea was for the users to immerse themselves in a planetarium environment where they are advised to lie down, and hypnotically follow a shooting star on the ceiling that bounces around a circular dorm, forming constellations as it flies.</p>

      <br>
      <p>With a clearer direction in mind, it was time to bring ideas to life. I set up the Unity project, which is the game engine utilised by Liminal. I implemented the company’s SDK (Software Development Kit) which allowed us to integrate their base controls and user experience into our unity project. I also cloned the entire project onto my desktop from the GitHub repository, which allowed me to seamlessly push and pull changes made to the project during development. To finish the week off, I fired up Adobe Illustrator and drafted a concept path that the shooting star may follow for the length of the experience, keeping in mind the formation of constellations.</p>

      <br>
      <p>During the week, we also caught up in person to further brainstorm, which we did using a Miro board. The idea was further refined and tasks were delegated. A personal idea that I offered that was accepted really well, was to have the shooting star enter the constellation from one end, form it, and shoot out the other, which enhances the calming experience, and also have the constellations derive from the existing (and well-known) zodiac. As well as a range of performant-saving ideas, such as using lower polygonal versions of models in the distance, and making the exterior of the planetarium empty space to create a sense of awe as well. Coming from a background in 3D modelling, I also offered sound advice to fellow interns.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Overall, it was an incredible and exhilarating week at Liminal, for it was the first time I’ve been in a work environment in my field. We made fantastic headway on the project, and next week will bring in a lot more implementation-related work. </p>
