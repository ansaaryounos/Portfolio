      <p>This week I was in Sweden for a family holiday, so I did not get up to much. I wasn’t able to attend the regular Monday meeting online due to the time difference, but I was able to catch up via the Slack chat. During the course of the week, I did simple tasks such as offering feedback and criticisms on others’ work, discussing how it could be improved for the project, and tweaking some settings in Unity. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The most notable thing I did while overseas was figure out how to bake all the lighting in our unity scene to maximise performance, as we had a great deal of real-time lighting that wasn’t preferred on the Liminal Platform. The difference between the two is that Unity pre-calculates the illumination from Baked Lights before run time, and does not include them in any run-time lighting calculations. By marking all the non-moving objects that needed to have their lighting baked as ‘static’ on Unity, the game engine knew what to do. All this baked data is then stored as a ‘lightmap’ in the project, which is then overlayed on top of all the models during run time. Here are some of the light maps used in our Reverberate project.</p>

      <br>
      <p>The last thing I did was organise the Unity project. Due to the many renditions of the planetarium, there were a lot of unused, disabled assets in the Scene’s hierarchy of models, and it was very unorganised and messy. I had the chance to clean it up, as this is what it looked like beforehand.</p>

      <p>Next week I will be back in Australia, finishing off the project hopefully.</p>
