      <p>This week was the final week assigned to our project, which meant we had to start wrapping things up. The majority of the project was done, but there were still some changes to be made. However, the week did not get off to a good start. One of the other interns accidentally reverted the project back 4 days, erasing a lot of work, as they had not been using the GitHub repository properly. Although we were able to revert a lot of the changes, a lot of damage control was necessary, and some stress relief. Once all was fixed and we were back to where we were before, we were able to start finishing off the project.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To begin with, I found the initial arrangement of mattresses on the floor to be incredibly messy as they were extending outside of the allocated space. I rearranged all the pillows and mattresses to fit within without compromising the player’s comfort. This took a lot of time to perfect. This was the final arrangement that worked the best.</p>

      <p>As the position of some of the assets had changed, it meant I needed to bake the lighting again. Although all the settings were there from the first bake, it took a very long time to bake as it is quite an intensive process.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Once done, the final thing that I needed to fix was the falling stars, as they had been falling from the beginning. I adjusted the code for them to wait until all the constellations are formed, and then begin to fall gradually. The other issue with the stars was that they were simply little squares. I added a proper and simple star texture to it to make it more believable, and sent the same star texture to our screen animator who replaced the dots of the ceiling animation with the matching stars, creating a cohesive aesthetic experience.</p>

      <p>The final week had come to an end. In essence, the project was finished and functional, but there was certainly room for improvement. We gave the project to Liminal to develop further if need be, advising them that they were better off finding a sound designer for the audio of the experience as nobody in our team was experienced in that field. Once the audio is fixed, it is ready to be published onto their platform. Regardless, it was a fantastic, challenging and collaborative experience working at Liminal VR, and I’m excited to see what the future brings for them and myself. Here is the final submission of our project, Reverberate, as a video clip.</p>
